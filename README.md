# CMPG-323-Project-5

In this project we will be using Microsoft Power BI to visualize our data in a report or a dashboard. These visual are then passed on to the stakeholders to view on how they or the organization iself can improve.
Now the user will have to create a new report on Power BI.
And then create 3 different pages:
1. High Level Metrics
2. Device monitoring
3. Device Registrition

In these 3 pages you will have different data visualition viewing data sourced from an excel file.
You will have to create a live connection between your file and Power BI desktop.

In this project you can view your data as it follows: 
1. High-Level Metrics - add a summary view that shows
business stakeholders a high-level
view of the ‘important’ data.
2. Device Monitoring - create a visual that allows the user to monitor devices per category, create a visual that allows the user
to monitor devices per zone and then create a visual that allows the user to monitor online versus offline
devices (status should depict
whether a device is online or offline)
3.Device Registration - create a visual that allows the user to see how many devices have been registered over a timespan, create a visual that allows the user
to see how many categories of devices have been created and create a visual that allows the user to see how many zones contain registered devices on a timeline.
And then you will have to use Filter across all your pages and visualization.
